  * Essentials of Business Statistics: Communicating with Numbers is a core statistics textbook that sparks student interest and bridges the gap between how statistics is taught and how practitioners think about and apply statistical methods.
 
  * Throughout the text, the emphasis is on communicating with numbers rather than on number crunching. By incorporating the perspective of professional users, the subject matter is more relevant and the presentation of material more straightforward for students.
 
  * Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, and how they need it, so that your class time is more engaging and effective.
